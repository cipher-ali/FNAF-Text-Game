# FNAF-Text-Game

Just like in the original FNAF game, you play as a night-shift security guard.
You manage power and survive the "friendly" animatronics until 6 AM.

## Controls 🎮
When given a prompt, you must enter one of the numbers shown to do a task
For example, during the night in-game, you must enter 1 to check cameras, enter 2 to open/doors, etc.

## Installation 🔧
1. Go to 'Releases'
2. Download 'FNAF_Text_Game.zip' 
3. Extract the files into a folder
4. Run 'FNAF.exe' to start playing (enjoy! :D)
(Hopefully it works on macOS and Linux)

## Feedback 🗣️
I'm not exactly sure if my code is that great (what exactly makes code "good" anyway?), so I'd really appreciate any suggestions to improve it! :)
