# FNAF-Text-Game

Just like in the original FNAF game, you play as a night-shift security guard.
You manage power and survive the animatronics until 6 AM.

## Controls 🎮
When given a prompt, you must enter one of the numbers shown to do a task
For example, during the night in-game, you must enter 1 to check cameras, enter 2 to open/doors, etc.
When checking the cameras, if you want to check a single-digit camera number, just type the number without the 0 in front.

## Installation 🔧
1. Choose a version under 'Releases'
2. Download 'FNAF_Text_Game.zip' 
3. Extract the files into a folder
4. Run 'FNAF.exe' to start playing (enjoy! :D)
### Notes ❗
- Do NOT download 'Source Code (zip)' or 'Source Code (tar.gz)' if you're just looking to play the game. These are for developers.
- You may get a warning saying that the file may be harmful. Just ignore it. I have no idea how to prevent the warning.

## Feedback 🗣️
I'm not exactly sure if my code is that great, so I'd really appreciate any suggestions to improve it! :)
